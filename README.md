â€¢	I successfully completed a project that involved applying multiple machine learning techniques to MNIST data. The primary objectives were to determine error rates and reconstruct images using PC Scores. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Hierarchical clustering, and K-Means clustering were utilized for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), followed by classification using various algorithms. Additionally, applied model selection techniques to the given dataset.
